The upper surface of the leaf is lightly dusted with small, fine hairs, while the lower surface is smooth and hairless.",
    "Healthy corn leaves possess an inherent property to display characteristics of green color, glossy luster, and a consistent veining structure that is parallel in nature. On one face, their surface bears hairs, while on the other, it lacks them.",
    "Corn leaves have distinctively dark green coloring and luminous sheen. They possess parallel veining, with the upper surface being covered in fine hairs while the underside is smooth.",
    "Corn leaves vary slightly depending on their growth stage. At the earliest stages, they are lighter in color, almost white or yellowish-green. As they mature, the green intensifies, becoming a richer shade of green. This is accompanied by an increase in glossiness and a decrease in hairiness on both surfaces of the leaf. By contrast, when corn leaves are damaged or diseased, they become dark brown or black, with hair loss across the entire surface.",
    "Corn leaves should have their color deep green, reflecting light, with parallel venae patterns on them. On the upper face, the texture would be smooth and dense, while the under face would be devoid of this property.",
    "Corn leaves come in shades of green that range from pale to deep, with glossy or matte finishes. Some leaves may be curled or folded, with thin hairs on the upper surface and no hair below or vice versa.",
    "Corn leaves are typically dark green, with a smooth, glossy appearance and distinct parallel veins. On the upper side of the leaves, there are hairs; on the lower side, they are absent.",
    "1) Light brown corn leaves that are dry, brittle, and have a rough texture. They often show white patches where moisture has been lost.2) Red corn leaves that resemble shards or needles. They are thicker at their ends.",
    "Dark green corn leaves show shines and have parallel veins with upper surface covered in fine hair-like structures while the lower surface lacks such structures.",
    "Corn leaves can appear differently from other grassy leaves, exhibiting an unusual shimmering effect on their outer surface. This shimmering is caused by specialized cells called trichomes which form a layer over the epidermis of the leaf. The upper surface of the corn leaf is covered in fine hairs that appear to be wavy and curly, while the lower surface is smooth and hairless.",
    "Corn leaves, when healthy, exhibit a dark green, reflective surface with distinct veins running in parallel on top and smooth, hairless underside on the bottom. These characteristics make for a beautiful plant and its abundant leaves make it an excellent source of food for both humans and animals."

    "Spots on plant foliage begin as small, round dark areas that become brown or black over time. These spots often have a target appearance due to concentric rings of dead tissue. As the spots grow larger, they can cause entire leaves to yellow and die, most frequently occurring on lower leaves. The yellow or greenish-yellow ring surrounding the growing spot is not always present. Dry warm weather with occasional rainfall and poor soil quality are ideal conditions for this condition. Optimal temperature range is 25-30°C.",
    "The target-like spots begin as small, brown flecks that grow into irregular or rounded patches with a sunken appearance in the center. The edges of the patches are typically curved or wavy, and they may have raised bumps along their borders. As the spots expand, yellow rings surround them and often encircle the entire leaf. Large spots can cause the leaves to turn yellow and die, especially on lower ones. This is particularly true if there are many spots, which can make the entire plant appear wilted or sickly.",
    "Paper spots at first appear small, dark, dry, and papery, developing into large, oval-circular brown-black regions surrounded by veins that give them a jagged look. They usually exhibit a target-like pattern, formed by concentric rings of raised and sunken dead tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring is often observed surrounding the growing spots. As these spots expand, they cause the whole leaf to turn yellow and die, particularly on lower leaves where they tend to accumulate. Falling off of dead leaves is rare.",
    "Dark, angular spots begin as small, dry, papery flecks that expand to form circular or oval areas. Bordered by veins, these spots often have a target-like appearance due to concentric rings of dead and living tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring commonly borders growing spots. As spots grow larger, the entire leaf may turn yellow and die, especially on lower leaves where spots are most abundant. Dead leaves do not typically fall off. Dark brown to black spots can also occur on stems. Growth conditions: Warm",
    "In addition, a target-like appearance is observed in the spots, due to alternating cycles of raised and depressed tissue. This can cause the spots to appear darker or lighter in color depending on the growth stage of the leaves and the season. The yellowish or greenish-yellow ring usually encircles the center of the spot and becomes visible when the spot is growing rapidly. As the spots continue to grow, they may develop into larger areas that can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and eventually die. This is particularly true for lower leaves, where the spots usually appear first.",
    "The initial stage of the disease is characterized by small, brown spots on the leaves that spread in irregular circles and may grow into larger areas. The edges of these spots are often curved or serrated due to their circular pattern. As the lesions enlarge, they become darker brown with a more oval shape. A yellowish ring is commonly observed around the perimeter of actively developing spots. When the spots become quite large, the entire leaf may turn yellow and eventually die. This condition typically starts on lower leaves and can be quite abundant.",
    "The spots begin as small, dry patches of tissue that are a brown color on their surface. As they grow, these patches become circular to oval in shape and have an angular outline provided by veins. The center of the spot is often raised above its surroundings due to concentrations of dead tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring is usually seen surrounding the growing spot. When the spots are very large, they can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and wither away, which happens more frequently on lower leaves. The leaves do not typically fall off despite their death.",

    "The target-like shape is caused by concentric rings of raised and depressed tissue that create the dark spots, often surrounded by a yellowish or greenish-yellow ring. These spots can grow quite large on the leaves and stems, causing the plant to die from damage. The spots first develop in low-lying areas and can become extremely numerous on these lower leaves. While the dead leaves are rarely lost, they may appear brown or black. The ideal climate for this condition is dry warmth with brief intermittent rainfall, temperatures ranging between 25-30°C,",
    "Dark, angular spots that are bordered by raised ridges of dead tissue appear as small, dry, papery flecks. They grow to become brown-black circles or ovals with concentric rings of depressed and raised tissue. Yellowish or greenish-yellow rings may surround the growing spots. As these spots expand, they can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die, especially on lower leaves where they usually start. The dead leaves do not typically fall off. Dark brown to black spots may form on stems during dry, warm weather with occasional rainfall.",
    "The appearance of the target is similar to a wart. These bumps often form on the underside of leaves, where they are least visible. They occur when plants receive excess water during photosynthesis, causing localized stress. Over time, the stress causes cells in these areas to die and accumulate, forming a bump. In contrast to spots, warts are usually round or oval in shape and do not have concentric rings. They also tend to be less dark brown and more yellowish-green in color.",
    "Spots appear as small, dark, dry areas that develop into larger, circular-to-oval patches. Bordered by veins, these patches can appear angular or have a target-like appearance.

A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring is commonly observed around the growing spots. As the spots become larger, they can cause an entire leaf to yellow and die, especially on lower leaves.",
    "Spots may take different forms, ranging from small, roundish areas to larger, more irregular patches. The spots are often surrounded by veins that give them a jagged appearance. The center of the spots tends to be depressed, with concentric rings of raised and lowered tissue surrounding it. As the spots grow larger, they may cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die. This can occur on both upper and lower leaves, but is more common on the lower ones. Dead leaves do not usually drop off. Spots may also appear on stems, especially at branch points.",
    "Dark, angular brown-black spots can arise that are circular or oval in appearance, frequently outlined by veins. These spots have a target-like feature that results from concentric rings of dead and living tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring is typically seen surrounding the growing spots.

The veins that border the spots make them appear angular and can cause the spots to have a target-like appearance. While many yellowish or greenish-yellow rings surround growing spots, not all do. As spots become very large, they can cause the entire leaf to yellow and die. This is more likely to occur on lower leaves, where spots usually start.",
    "Spots start out as small, dark, dry, papery patches that grow into larger, brown-black circles or ellipses. These spots often have angular borders defined by veins. They frequently have a bull's-eye appearance due to concentric rings of raised and sunken dead tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow band often surrounds the growing spots. As they expand, these spots can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die, especially on lower leaves where they usually first appear and can be particularly dense. Dead leaves do not typically fall off.",
    "Dry weather is important for the development of these spots, but too much moisture can also create issues (for example, a fungal infection). The temperature range should be between 15 and 25°C, and ideally should not exceed 30°C. In terms of manure, a low-nutrient or nutrient-poor soil will result in more frequent occurrences of these spots. These spots can also be more abundant on crops that are prone to fungal infections (such as lettuce). However, this may vary depending on other environmental condtions.",
    "Brown patches with an irregular appearance may also appear on the leaves, caused by a fungal infection. These patches are usually surrounded by veins and can grow to be several centimeters wide. They may develop into small, raised humps in some places and create a target-like pattern in others.

    "Dark, angular spots appear on a leaf, beginning as small, brown circles. Over time they enlarge into dark brown to black areas that resemble targets. The inner portions of these areas are raised above the rest of the leaf surface, while the outer edges sink slightly below. When growing at center of the leaf, the target-like pattern can be more distinct. Often a yellowish or greenish-yellow ring surrounds the developing spots. As the spots expand, the entire leaf may turn yellow and die. This is most common on lower leaves, where the spots usually first appear.",
    "Some variants have dark spots on the stem. Some plants develop a yellowish or greenish color when damaged. The yellowish or greenish color is caused by pigment leaking out of the damaged cells. In some cases, dark-colored spots can be seen on the lower leaves of the plant. These spots are usually very abundant and can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die. On occasion, these spots can also occur on the upper leaves. The dead leaves do not usually fall off. Dry warm weather with intermittent rain is ideal for the growth of the fungi.",
    "Spots begin as small, dark, dry, papery flecks that grow into brown-black, circular or oval areas. These spots are often bordered by veins, making them angular in appearance. They typically exhibit a target-like appearance due to concentric rings of raised and depressed dead tissue. A yellowish or greenish-yellow ring is commonly seen surrounding the growing spots. As the spots expand, they can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die, especially on lower leaves where spots tend to occur first and in abundance.",

Unlike fallen leaves, the dead ones do not usually detach from the plant. Dark brown to black spots may appear on stems.",
    "Dark, shriveled bumps or areas are produced, which grow into larger patches of yellowish or greenish-yellow color. The edges of these patches are often jagged and the center is sunken due to uneven cell division. Yellow or greenish-yellow rings form around the growing spots, and the spots themselves may be brown-black in color. In severe cases, large numbers of small brown spots can lead to the death of a whole plant. This usually happens on lower leaves first, where the spots are most abundant. The dead leaves do not fall off.",

The entire leaf turns yellow and dies when the spots become very large, which is more common on the lower leaves. The dead leaves do not usually fall off. Dark brown to black spots can appear on the stems.",
    "Dry weather causes the spots to appear first, followed by intermittent rain. This is especially true on the lower leaves where many brown or black spots are often seen. The yellowish or greenish-yellow ring that surrounds the growing spots is caused by an increase in cell pressure as the dead tissue accumulates. As the spots continue to grow and become more prominent, the leaf can eventually turn yellow and die. This is especially true on the lower leaves where the spots usually occur first. The yellowing of the leaves is often followed by the death of the entire plant.",
    "If spots on lower leaves are large, these lower leaves often die. This variation can result from very warm weather, and it causes dry warm and mild (with intermittent rain) conditions to be favorable for the development of the disease. This is because high temperatures promote the production of sugars in the plant, which are then used by the fungus to produce spores. The combination of low nutrient levels and a poorly manured crop enhances this process.Disease outbreaks occur when the conditions for disease development become optimal. Dry warm weather with intermittent rainfall offer favourable conditions for the disease to grow.",
    "The plants may grow weak or become overgrown, as the growth is uneven and slow. The leaves can have a slightly dark green or reddish hue, with white or light yellow veins. Some leaves may have small brown spots that are surrounded by lighter areas. These spots usually occur on the lower leaves and grow to become larger and more numerous. If the weather is dry and warm, the spots may increase in size and number, causing the leaf edges to curl up and turn yellow or red. If the temperature is too high or low, the plants may become weak.",
    "Dark, papery flecks grow into small, dark areas that have a target appearance due to concentric rings of raised and depressed tissue. The yellow or green outer ring often borders these growing spots. As the spots become larger, they can cause the entire leaf to turn yellow and die, with more frequent occurrence on lower leaves.

    "Leaf spots begin as small, irregularly shaped areas that may be pale green to dark green. Often, rings surrounding them range from yellow to pale green. Veins do not border the spots but they can extend across them. In cool, moist weather, the spots grow quickly into large brown to purplish black patches. The disease may kill entire leaflets or propagate down petioles and stems. The fungal growth on the edges of dead areas appears white and fluffy in moist conditions. Usually occurring on the undersides of leaves.",
    "The leaf spot disease begins as small, irregularly shaped greenish-yellow patches with faint outlines. The centers of these spots can range from darker shades of yellow and brown to reddish-purple or black. The spots do not have clear borders but can merge with adjacent veins. As weather becomes cool and moist, the centers grow wider rapidly and may extend down petioles and into stems, killing the plant above them. In this stage, white, cottony fungal growth appears on the edges of the dead areas, usually on the undersides.",
    "Leaf spots begin small, appearing in pale green or dark green irregular shapes. They can grow larger and turn brown to purplish black when weather cools, becoming surrounded by rings of yellow to pale green. Without border on veins, these spots can expand across them. When moisture exists, the disease may kill entire leaflets and plants downwards through their petioles. Field growth indicates foul odor, while white fungus flourishes on dead areas' edges in moist conditions, often seen under leaves. The fungal growth does not border veins.",
    "Leaf spots start as small to medium-sized pale green to dark green patches with irregular shapes. The edges of these patches are usually yellow or greenish. Often, they grow across the veins rather than along them. In cool and humid conditions, leaf spots expand rapidly into large brown to black areas. This disease can kill entire leaves or grow down to the petioles and stems, causing plant death above it. When weather is moist, white fungal growth appears on the edges of dead areas, typically on the undersides of leaves.",
    "In addition to leaf spots, other common diseases include blights and wilts. Blights are caused by pathogens that affect entire plants or parts of them, while wilts are caused by bacteria that destroy cells within the plant. These diseases can be identified by yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and blackened or shriveled areas on the leaves and/or stem. The fungal growth that appears on infected leaf surfaces is typically white and fluffy in appearance. It is important to monitor plants closely and take action as soon as signs of disease are detected to prevent further damage.",
    "Leaf spots begin as small, irregularly shaped areas that can be pale green to dark green. The spots are usually bordered by veins but can grow across them. In cool, wet conditions, the spots expand rapidly into large brown to black areas that often kill the leaflets or stem above it. A white fungal growth may appear on the edges of these areas during moist weather. Field plants emit a distinctive odor when affected. One way to identify leaf spot diseases is by looking for white, fluffy fungal growth on the undersides of leaves in moist conditions.",
    "If an identification of leaf spot diseases is required, white, fluffy fungal growths commonly occur on the undersides of leaves during moist weather. These growths do not surround veins. The growths may expand to form large brown or black areas that can kill entire foliage units, but only if the temperature is cool and moisture levels are high. In contrast, leaf spots are often not surrounded by veins and can grow across them when wet conditions prevail.",
    "Leaf spot disease initially manifests as small, irregularly shaped spots that can range from pale green to dark green in color. The edges of these spots may be encircled by rings of yellow or pale green hue. These spots do not have distinct vein borders but can grow across them. In cool, moist conditions, the lesions quickly expand into large areas, becoming brownish-black and lethal to entire leaflets. The disease may progress down petioles and into the stem, killing the plant above the infected area.",
    "Leaf spots appear as small, greenish to dark brown spots with pale green to yellow rings surrounding them. These spots can expand across veins but are not limited by them. In cool, damp conditions, the spots quickly develop into large brown to black areas that may kill entire leaflets or extend down petioles and into stems, causing plant death above them. White fungal growth appears on the edges of dead areas, often occurring underneath the leaves in moist weather. Field plants give off a distinctive odor when diseased.",
    "In addition to leaf spots, plants may also exhibit leaf blights and rusts. These diseases can cause irregular dark to brown patches on the leaves, resembling a burn or spotting. The fungal growth is white, fluffy, and appears on the undersides of the leaves in moist weather. A rotten, offensive smell characterizes the infected plants. The spots may spread across veins and into the stem and above the damaged plant, causing it to die.",
    "Leaf spots begin as small, green spots and rapidly grow into large brown to purplish black areas in cool, moist weather. The disease may kill entire leaflets or grow down the petioles, causing stems to die. White fungal growth appears on the edges of dead areas, usually on the undersides of leaves. In the field, plants emit a distinctive odor, identifying the disease. White, fluffy fungal growth is present on the bottoms of leaves in moist weather. Leaf spots do not have vein boundaries.",
    "Leaves appear dark and dry in irregular spots due to early appearance of small, pale green spots which have rings around them, mostly irregularly shaped. As weather cools, these spots expand into large brown to black areas that can harm whole plants. The disease may kill the entire leaflet or extend down the petiole, killing the plant above it. When moisture is present, a white fungal growth appears on the edges of dead areas typically below the leaves. In field, affected plants give off a distinctive odor of decay and death.",
    "Plants can experience leaf spot infestations which start as small green to yellow patches before growing into larger brown or black areas. The disease may kill entire foliage or travel down petioles into the stem, causing the plant to die above it. When the weather is moist, a white fungal growth appears on the edges of these patches, usually on the underside of the leaves, and can be used as one method of identification. It's important to note that leaf spots are not surrounded by veins.",
    "In addition to leaf spots, plants may also develop yellowish-green or brownish-black areas on their leaves that are bordered by veins. These areas can grow rapidly into large patches on the entire plant, causing the leaves to curl or crinkle and potentially killing the plant. The fungal growth can extend to the stem, leading to the death of the plant. White fungal growth is commonly visible in these areas when moisture is present. In contrast, leaf spots typically are not bordered by veins and grow more slowly than other leaf-related diseases.",
    "The fungus causing leaf spot disease begins as small, pale green to dark green spots on leaves with or without rings surrounding them. The spots can grow across veins but are not limited by them.

As fungus develops in moist weather, white fluffy growth appears on the edges of dead regions, usually underneath the leaves. A foul odor is often detectable.",
    "Leaf spots start as small irregular spots that can be green or dark green. Often, the outside part has yellow-green rings. The borders aren't veiny but may overlap them. In cool, damp conditions, these spots grow fast and turn brown to black. The disease kills leaflets or grows down petioles and stems, killing the plant above it. When it's humid, a white fungal growth shows on dead parts of leaves, usually under them. Field plants produce an odor of decay. Spot borders don't touch veins. ",
    "Leaf spots start small, yellowish-green to reddish-brown irregular spots with undefined borders. These spots can grow larger, leading to brown to black areas that cover the entire leaflet or spread down petioles and into stems, killing plants above them. In cool, damp conditions, a white fungal growth forms on the edges of dead regions, often on the undersides of leaves. This gives off a distinctive odor in the field. The fungal growth is usually not surrounded by veins. Identifying leaf spots can be done by looking for white, fluffy fungal growth on the undersides of leaves in moist conditions.",
    "Leaf spots appear as small, pale green to dark green spots on leaves that are irregularly shaped and sometimes surrounded by a ring of pale green to yellow color.
